		<p>Memory containment device.<br>Inside this wooden frame lives an expierence that a loving family had. So great this expierence was, <br>that they decided to capture it and have it live forever inside this frame. If won, we at Exquisite Auctions ask <br>that you do not replace this memory, as doing so will remove it permanetly from the minds of the family<br> who holds it so dear. Look at that child riding on her parents back. She is so happy and free and innocent. <br> How dare you consider taking that away from her. And the parents. Mom and Dad. Yeah, maybe things<br> haven't been great since, well, the incident. But this vacation really made them both stand back and appreciate <br>the life they have built together. Replacing that with some poorly lit film photography of a piece of trash<br> on a city sidewalk would be a crime. We here at Exquisite Auctions hope that the swift and strong fist of justice <br>come down upon thee. <br>Exquisite Auctions is not responsible for the swift and strong arm of justic or its actions. </p>
